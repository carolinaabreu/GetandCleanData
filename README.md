This repository contains my solution to the Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment (see description below).

To run this project you will need the data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Unpack the data as to have 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory and its subdirectories inside your working directory.
Copy run_analysis.R to your working directory.
Install the 'plyr' package if you don't have it.
The run_analysis.R will

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Generate a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Export this final tidy data to a 'tidyData.csv' in your working directory.
